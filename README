# Craftbukkit server for Raspberry Pi API presentation


If you feel comfortable installing software, then there are some instructions for doing it yourself.

Here is distribution of Craftbukkit that includes the raspberry juice module. You can check the project out or simply download the zip package. The link to the zip package should be on the right.

The instructions are for Windows. If you are using a Mac or Linux, change the parts that are appropriate.

You should have already have Python 2.7  installed and Java installed. After you have installed Python and Java, follow the instructions below

* Unzip the package in the desktop.

* Double click on run.bat. This will start the server.

* Start minecraft on your laptop. Select multiple player, and then find the localhost craftbukkit server. Log into that world.

* click on, console.bat This will open a console in the development folder

* Run the test script

python block.py

You should see text output on the server console, and a block should appear near you  in minecraft. If this works, then you have installed everything correctly.

# Start poking around

If you have installed this package before the presentation, start poking around. Change values in the code. See what happens. If you figured out something cool, be sure to be ready to share it the day of the presentation.
